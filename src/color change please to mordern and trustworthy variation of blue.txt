Okay, seeing the laptop view gives a much better context! You're right, a modern and trustworthy variation of blue would work well with this layout.

Here's how we can implement that, keeping in mind the existing elements:

**Color Palette Suggestion (Modern & Trustworthy Blues)**

* **Primary Blue:** `#2980B9` (A bright, professional blue)
* **Secondary Blue/Teal:** `#48C9B0` (A slightly lighter, vibrant teal)
* **Background:** `#F5F5F5` (A very light off-white)
* **Text:** `#333` (A dark gray, almost black)

**Implementation in the Layout**

1.  **Header (Top Navigation):**
    * Keep the light background (as you have) or use the off-white `#F5F5F5`.
    * Use the primary blue `#2980B9` for the active navigation links and important icons (like the search icon).
    * Use the dark gray `#333` for the regular navigation text.

2.  **Left Sidebar (Category Navigation):**
    * Keep the current light background.
    * Use the primary blue `#2980B9` for the active category or when a category is hovered.
    * Use the dark gray `#333` for the regular category text.

3.  **Promotional Banner (Middle Section):**
    * Use the primary blue `#2980B9` for the "Up to 10% off Voucher" text and the "Shop Now" button.
    * Consider using the secondary teal `#48C9B0` as an accent color for a subtle gradient or highlight in the banner.

4.  **Product Cards (Flash Sales):**
    * Keep the white background for the cards.
    * Use the primary blue `#2980B9` or the secondary teal `#48C9B0` for price highlights or "Add to Cart" buttons.

5.  **Mobile Navigation (Gray Background):**
    * If you keep the gray background for mobile, ensure the text has sufficient contrast.
    * Try adding a subtle accent of the primary blue `#2980B9` (e.g., a line or highlight) to tie it into the overall color scheme.

**Why This Works**

* **Professionalism:** The primary blue `#2980B9` conveys trust and professionalism, suitable for an e-commerce platform.
* **Modern Feel:** The secondary teal `#48C9B0` adds a touch of modern vibrancy without being overpowering.
* **Readability:** The dark gray text `#333` provides excellent readability against the light background.
* **Clean Look:** The off-white background `#F5F5F5` creates a clean and modern look.

**Considerations**

* **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in color usage throughout the website for a cohesive brand experience.
* **Accessibility:** Double-check the color contrast to ensure readability for all users.
* **Testing:** Test the color scheme on different devices and browsers to ensure it looks good across various platforms.
